It is a little bit confusing at first because of the private and public members of the defined class. Privatizing members within the class type is important because the user of the application doesn't need to see everything that the application program has. So me as the developer of the application, I need to identify which class members need to be private and which members should be placed in public of the class. Formatting without using iomanip is a little bit tricky since you need to understand the logic of the formatting on where and when to put whitespace or newline. I have learned to be patient making this workshop because it looks easy and simple when you're looking at the correct output but when you're doing the whole program it's a different situation because you need to understand the way the program should handle every input and proper error messages that are necessary for a certain situation.

This submitted     piece of work is entirely of my own creation.     ******************************************************************************/This workshop helps me to work with multiple files, it makes more sense to create or understand a program that are made pieces by pieces. Since, each logic is created separately by means of a function, checking for errors or bugs is much easier because I only need to look for the function/s that is/are having a bug or error. This also gives me a good foundation for compiling functions that are working together under the same module as graph.cpp and graph.h because they have the functions that are used in printing the graph, for io.cpp it has the functions that works with input and output. So, in future, if I need some functions that will deal with input and output or printing a graph, I can easily look for it because the module name is describing itself on what is the contents under them. When creating the StMark.cpp, it helps me to organize my program by adding more functions to make printReport easier to read and maintain. I added bubbleSort and categorizeStudent functions so that printReport function will not be so crowded because it will look like a mess. Base on my understanding creating a clean and easier to maintain code is needed in this field so It is a good practice for me to make every program that I will create to be organize and easier to maintain. Also, it makes debugging and changing values easier if it is needed in the future.

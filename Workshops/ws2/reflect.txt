But the good thing with that was, that I can add more knowledge and learnings to be careful allocating and deallocating memory in my program. Based on the error message that I'm getting in the first part of my submitting my workshop, I was so confused that my output matched the format but I'm always having a memory leak issue. There are parts of our course notes that talk about overloading and I think memory leak can be related to it in some parts. This workshop also gives me a chance to enhance my debugging knowledge since I need to find where the memory leaks are occurring and when my output doesn't print the desired output. This workshop also taught me to check all the conditional statements because the guest set function of my workshop seems to work properly but the problem occurs when the print function is called, so that gives me the idea that something is wrong with the conditions on my guest set function because when I walk through to my code my set function are setting the first and last name to null after it was conditionally checked in that function block.

In the same way as unary operators, it gives me insight into how important its role is in the program since you can easily see what the function's job is on the program whether it will increment or decrement values in short it is self-describing. It's all the same with the binary member operator and helper function, these functions give me a clear understanding of how they work as they allow the application to be clearer, and more intuitive code and improve the encapsulation of the operation logic within the classes. At last, the formatted output via cout improves the clarity, consistency and give more robust output for the application.

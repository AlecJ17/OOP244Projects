The destructors have the functionality of a deallocate function. Also, this workshop makes my undestanding more deepen on private and public members of the class. Since, I identify which member should be inside the private and public. I notice that the default of class was its member is automatically set in private if it is not set to public unlike struct function it is the reverse version of class. The encapsulation of the class makes it object oriented since you will write the logic of every function within its class. At last, this workshop helps me to understand how to handle dynamic resources with the use of constructor and destructor. And ostream& Guitar::display(ostream& os) const function makes it more clear since it will return the proper display and makes the code more readable and cleaner.
